  abstract = 	 {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   }

  abstract  = "In this paper we study a family of gradient descent algorithms to approximate the regression function from reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), the family being characterized by a polynomial decreasing rate of step sizes (or learning rate). By solving a bias-variance trade-off we obtain an early stopping rule and some probabilistic upper bounds for the convergence of the algorithms. We also discuss the implication of these results in the context of classification where some fast convergence rates can be achieved for plug-in classifiers. Some connections are addressed with Boosting, Landweber iterations, and the online learning algorithms as stochastic approximations of the gradient descent method. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer.",
