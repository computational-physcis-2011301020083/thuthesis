abstract = "Two-jet mass distributions have been measured as a function of centre-of-mass scattering angle for high-mass jet pairs produced in proton-antiproton collisions at the CERN collider operating at a centre-of-mass energy of 630 GeV. The agreement between QCD expectations and the experimental measurements has been used to place limits on the production cross section of an object X decaying into two jets. In particular we consider the existence of a massive colour octet of vector gauge bosons (axigluons). We exclude axigluons with a width ΛA < 0.4mA and a mass mA in the range 150 < mA < 310 GeV/c2 (95\%CL)."

The mass of an additional W boson that couples to fermions with a V+A form is constrained to be greater than 261 GeV to the 90\% confidence level. A limit on the production cross section of additional W and Z bosons is given as a function of the boson mass. A limit on the production of excited quarks is also given as a function of the excited quark mass."
