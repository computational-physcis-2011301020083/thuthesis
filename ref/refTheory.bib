abstract = "Within the standard 3ν mass–mixing framework, we present an up-to-date global analysis of neutrino oscillation data (as of January 2016), including the latest available results from experiments with atmospheric neutrinos (Super-Kamiokande and IceCube DeepCore), at accelerators (first T2K ν‾ and NOνA ν runs in both appearance and disappearance modes), and at short-baseline reactors (Daya Bay and RENO far/near spectral ratios), as well as a reanalysis of older KamLAND data in the light of the “bump” feature recently observed in reactor spectra. We discuss improved constraints on the five known oscillation parameters (δm2, |Δm2|, sin2⁡θ12, sin2⁡θ13, sin2⁡θ23), and the status of the three remaining unknown parameters: the mass hierarchy [sign(±Δm2)], the θ23 octant [sign(sin2⁡θ23−1/2)], and the possible CP-violating phase δ. With respect to previous global fits, we find that the reanalysis of KamLAND data induces a slight decrease of both δm2 and sin2⁡θ12, while the latest accelerator and atmospheric data induce a slight increase of |Δm2|. Concerning the unknown parameters, we confirm the previous intriguing preference for negative values of sin⁡δ (with best-fit values around sin⁡δ≃−0.9), but we find no statistically significant indication about the θ23 octant or the mass hierarchy (normal or inverted). Assuming an alternative (so-called LEM) analysis of NOνA data, some δ ranges can be excluded at >3σ, and the normal mass hierarchy appears to be slightly favored at ∼90% C.L. We also describe in detail the covariances of selected pairs of oscillation parameters. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of the above results on the three non-oscillation observables sensitive to the (unknown) absolute ν mass scale: the sum of ν masses Σ (in cosmology), the effective νe mass mβ (in beta decay), and the effective Majorana mass mββ (in neutrinoless double beta decay)."

abstract = "Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin."

The idea has its origin in the following shared characteristics: 1. Both forces affect equally all forms of matter -leptons as well as hadrons. 2. Both are vector in character. 3. Both (individually) possess universal coupling strengths. }

    abstract = { The new mechanics of the atom introduced by Heisenberg may be based on the assumption that the variables that describe a dynamical system do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, but satisfy instead certain quantum conditions. One can build up a theory without knowing anything about the dynamical variables except the algebraic laws that they are subject to, and can show that they may be represented by matrices whenever a set of uniformising variables for the dynamical system exists. It may be shown, however (see 3), that there is no set of uniformising variables for a system containing more than one electron, so that the theory cannot progress very far on these lines. A new development of the theory has recently been given by Schrödinger. Starting from the idea that an atomic system cannot be represented by a trajectory, i. e., by a point moving through the co-ordinate space, but must be represented by a wave in this space, Schrödinger obtains from a variation prin­ciple a differential equation which the wave function ψ must satisty. This differential equation turns out to be very closely connected with the Hamiltonian equation which specifies the system, namely, if H (qr, Pr - W = 0 is the Hamiltonian equation of the system, where the qr, Pr are canonical variables, then the wave equation for ψ is {H(q r, ih ∂/∂q) - W} ψ = 0. }

abstract = "Some questions concerning the ideal Bose-Einstein gas are reviewed and examined further. The bulk behavior including the condensation phenomenon is characterized by the thermodynamical properties, occupations of the states and their fluctuations, and the properties of the density matrices, including the diagonal and off-diagonal long range orders. Particular attention is focused on the difference between the canonical and grand canonical ensembles and a case is made that the latter does not represent any physical system in the condensed region. The properties in a finite region are also examined to study the approach to the bulk limit and secondly to derived the surface properties such as the surface tension (due to the boundary). This is mainly done for the special case of a rectangular parallelopiped (box) for various boundary conditions. The question of the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuations in the occupation of the ground state in the condensed region in the canonical ensemble is examined for these systems. Finally, the local properties near the wall of a half infinite system are calculated and discussed. The surface properties also follow this way and agree with the strictly thermodynamic result. Although it is not intended to be a complete review, it is largely self-contained, with the first section containing the basic formulas and a discussion of some general concepts which will be needed. Especially discussed in detail are the extra considerations that are needed in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to include the surface properties, and the quantum hierarchy of the density matrices and local conservation laws. In the concluding remarks several problems are mentioned which need further analysis and clarification."

abstract = "The four LEP Collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected a total of 2461 pb−1 of e+e− collision data at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four Collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV/c2 is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson."

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

abstract = "We report the results of two searches made on data recorded at the CERN SPS Proton-Antiproton Collider: one for isolated large-ET electrons, the other for large-ET neutrinos using the technique of missing transverse energy. Both searches converge to the same events, which have the signature of a two-body decay of a particle of mass ∼80 GeV/c2. The topology as well as the number of events fits well the hypothesis that they are produced by the proces p̄+p→W±+X, with W± →e±+ν; where W± is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic inter- actions."
