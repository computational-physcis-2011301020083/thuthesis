In this document we discuss promising future research and development areas in machine learning in particle physics with a roadmap for their implementation, software and hardware resource requirements, collaborative initiatives with the data science community, academia and industry, and training the particle physics community in data science. The main objective of the document is to connect and motivate these areas of research and development with the physics drivers of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and future neutrino experiments and identify the resource needs for their implementation. Additionally we identify areas where collaboration with external communities will be of great benefit.}

The expectation (or mean) value of MSWD=1 and is not a function of f. However, the +1Ï range of the expectation value of the MSWD decreases with increasing f. The standard deviation of the MSWD is Ï = Â±(2/f)1/2. If MSWD 1+2(2/f)1/2, there is only <5\% probability that the data define an isochron. Use of MSWD as a criterion for accepting or rejecting the assumption of an isochron may be applied only if analytical errors Ïxi and Ïyi are well known."

scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a
brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the
flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors
covering most of the 4Ï solid angle.  Forward sampling
calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values
(|Î·|Â â©½Â 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall
dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion
detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction
sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of
strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values
of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides
running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with
lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs.
ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to
collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several
QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors.
The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently
over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. 
Its overall dimensions are 16Â ÃÂ 16Â ÃÂ 26 m3 with a total weight 
of approximately
10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each
with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven
both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected
at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme
particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The
different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum
resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad
range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC.
This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons,
and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei.
Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data 
taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, 
with the exception of
parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector
(TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be
completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010.

This paper describes in detail the detector components as
installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.}

	abstract = {ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of the four experiments ready for p-p collisions scheduled in autumn 2009 at the LHC at CERN. It is a general purpose experiment, with a physics program that spans from the search of the Higgs Boson to the evidence of physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Events with final state muons are a signature of the most promising physics channels, e.g. the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying into four muons (H â 4Î¼). For this reason a completely independent in-air Muon Spectrometer with a toroidal magnetic field for muon track measurement has been realized to trigger and measure the momentum of high energy muons. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) provide the first-level muon trigger and the measurement of the coordinate in the non-bending direction in the barrel region of the Muon Spectrometer. The installation in the experimental hall of RPCs has been completed and extensive tests of their performance have been performed with cosmic-rays muons. An overview of the ATLAS experiment, focusing on the results of the studies on the RPCs performance will be presented.}

    abstract = { 1. Bhabha and Heitler (1937) and also Carlson and Oppenheimer (1937) have recently proposed a very ingenious theory of showers which explains nearly all the observed phenomena; both these treatments, however, contain approximations the validity of which cannot always be justified. The calculations of the first two authors make use of the method of successive approximations whose exactness is difficult to estimate, while the second authors replace one of the fundamental equations by a different one, and it is impossible to see how this replacement may distort the final result. Consequently, we have thought it useful to make the calculation in a more rigorous way; the fundamental physical ideas, however, are exactly the same as those of the authors mentioned above. 2. Consider a fast electron penetrating into a layer of matter; as long as its energy is below a certain order of magnitude, the loss of energy of the electron will be determined mainly by ionization; for higher energies, however, loss of energy by radiation (Bremsstrahlung) becomes more important. This critical energy lies in the region of about Ïµ = 750/ZÌ million volts, where ZÌ denotes a certain average nuclear charge (there may be several nuclei of different kinds present). Since the collision radiation, which is determined by the interaction between the electron and the nuclear field, increases as Z2, while the ionization is approximately proÂ­portional to the number of electrons in the material. }

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The ATLAS trigger successfully collected collision data during the first run of the LHC between 2009-2013 at different centre-of-mass energies between 900 GeV and 8TeV. The trigger system consists of a hardware Level-1 and a software-based high level trigger (HLT) that reduces the event rate from the design bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of a few hundred Hz. In Run-2, the LHC will operate at centre-of-mass energies of 13 and 14 TeV and higher luminosity, resulting in up to five times higher rates of processes of interest. A brief review of the ATLAS trigger system upgrades that were implemented between Run-1 and Run-2, allowing to cope with the increased trigger rates while maintaining or even improving the efficiency to select physics processes of interest, will be given. This includes changes to the Level-1 calorimeter and muon trigger systems, the introduction of a new Level-1 topological trigger module and the merging of the previously two-level HLT system into a single event processing farm. A few examples will be shown, such as the impressive performance improvements in the HLT trigger algorithms used to identify leptons, hadrons and global event quantities like missing transverse energy. Finally, the status of the commissioning of the trigger system and its performance during the 2015 run will be presented.}

ATLAS has adopted two independent methods for modeling pile-up and its effect on analyses. The first is a bottom-up approach, using a detailed simulation of the detector to recreate each component of the pile-up background. The second uses specially recorded data events to emulate it. This article reports on the experience using both of these methods, including performance considerations, for simulating pile-up in ATLAS.}

Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.}

Described in this paper are primary vertex reconstruction strategies implemented in the ATLAS software framework Athena. The implementation of the algorithms follows a very modular design based on object oriented C++ and the use of abstract interfaces. This guarantees the easy use and exchange of different vertex fitters and finders which are considered for a given analysis. Such a modular approach relies on a dedicated Event Data Model for vertex reconstruction. The data model has been developed alongside the reconstruction algorithms. Its design is presented in detail. The performance of the implemented primary vertex reconstruction algorithms has been studied on a variety of Monte Carlo samples and results are presented.}

We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

We propose a novel technique, based on jet areas, that provides jet-by-jet corrections for pileup and underlying-event effects. It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions."

abstract = "A new model for hadronic jet fragmentation in hard processes is presented. It is based on a QCD parton branching mechanism with correct treatment of leading collinear and infra-red singularities (i.e. including soft gluon interference). Hadronization occurs via preconfinement of colour singlet clusters, which decay according to a simple phase-space scheme. Although tightly constrained, the model gives a good account of existing e+ eâ annihilation data. It predicts significant differences between quark and gluon jets. Comparisons with datadata on the CERN pÌp collider jets suggest that a large fraction of them are gluon jets. The model predicts soft gluon interference effects in hadron distributions which are probably not yet observable for pions but should be clear for kaons and baryons."

abstract = "The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies.
Program summary
Program title: Pythia 8.1 Catalogue identifier: ACTU_v3_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU_v3_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GPL version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 176â981 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2â411â876 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: Commodity PCs Operating system: Linux; should also work on other systems RAM: 8 megabytes Classification: 11.2 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, partly Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models, transition from Fortran to C++. Summary of revisions: New user interface, transverse-momentum-ordered showers, interleaving with multiple interactions, and much more. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10â1000 events per second, depending on process studied. References: [1] T. SjÃ¶strand, P. EdÃ©n, C. Friberg, L. LÃ¶nnblad, G. Miu, S. Mrenna, E. Norrbin, Comput. Phys.

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations of physics events, including detailed simulation of the detector response, are indispensable for every analysis of high-energy physics experiments. As these simulated data sets must be both large and precise, their production is a CPU-intensive task. Increasing the recorded luminosity at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and hence the amount of data to be analyzed, leads to a steadily rising demand for simulated MC statistics for systematics and background studies. These huge MC requirements for more refined physics analyses can only be met through the implementation of fast simulation strategies which enable faster production of large MC samples. ATLAS has developed full and fast detector simulation techniques to achieve this goal within the computing limits of the collaboration. We present Atlfast-II which uses the FastCaloSim package in the calorimeter and reduces the simulation time by one order of magnitude by means of parameterizations of the longitudinal and lateral energy profile, and Atlfast-IIF with the fast track simulation engine Fatras, which achieves a further simulation time reduction of one order of magnitude in the Inner Detector and Muon System. Finally we present the new Integrated Simulation Framework (ISF) which is based on the requirement to allow to run all simulation types in the same job, even within the same sub-detector, for different particles. The ISF is designed to be extensible to new simulation types as well as the application of parallel computing techniques in the future. It can be easily configured by the user to find an optimal balance between precision and execution time, according to the specific physics requirements for their analysis.}
